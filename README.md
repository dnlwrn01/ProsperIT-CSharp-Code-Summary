## Intro
For this project, I joined a team of developers working on a local Theatre Production application. The application is intended as a platform to share A Productions Date/Time, Blog Posts, and Space Rental. Majority of my time was spent creating a structure for Calendar Events to be Added, Edited, Updated, and Deleted. This was completed using ASP.NET MVC.
